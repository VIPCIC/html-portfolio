 <H1>The Best Movies According to CIC</H1>

 <h2>My top 5 movies I have seen recently</h2><hr/>

    <h3>Children of Men</h3>
    <p>This movie starts boring but picks up pace the moment a black girl was discovered to be pregnant in a world where women were conceiving</p>

    <h3>John Wick</h3>
    <p>John Wick is a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the killing of his dog. The movie is action-packed and has a lot of gunfights</p>

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>Interstellar is probably my favourite space travel movie but passengers 2016 is too close to be number 2. It is a movie about a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity</p>

    <h3>Passengers</h3>
    <p>This one is about romance in space and it is beautifully done. I can't blame the man's decision to wake her up. Passengers is a movie about two people who wake up 90 years too early from an induced hibernation on a spaceship bound for a new planet</p>

    <h3>Den of thieves 2</h3>
    <p>Den of thieves 2 is a movie about a group of bank robbers who plan to rob the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles</p>
